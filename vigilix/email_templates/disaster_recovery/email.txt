There are 2 types of hard drives: those which have failed, and those that have not failed - yet.

Did you know that 76% of all data loss is due to user error or hardware failure?

Business data goes hand in hand with business operations.  The impact
of lost data is an inability to operate and a loss of your company's
reputation.  Important data related to gift cards or frequent
customers may never be recovered.  Without the proper process and
systems in place, rebuilding lost data is expensive and time
consuming.

Data is the most difficult item to replace - There is no substitute,
you either have it or you don't. 

Tape drives are inefficient and unreliable and have 30% failure rate;
any type of on-site storage does not protect you from fire, theft,
viruses, power surges, internal hardware failure or user error. 

Virtual Technician provides you with a disaster recovery solution that
you can depend on and trust: 

* Virtual Technician automatically encrypts, compresses and transfers
  files to an offsite location for storage and on-demand retrieval.

* Alert notification if there is an issue with a back-up process.

* Data is stored offsite in mirrored SAS 70 - Type II data centers.

Stop wondering if your data is safe and start knowing.

solution for your business.
