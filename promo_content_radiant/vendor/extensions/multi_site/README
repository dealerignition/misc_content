= Multi Site

Created by Sean Cribbs, November 2007. Inspired by the original virtual_domain
behavior. Extended by Nick Plante, March 2008. 

Multi Site allows you to host multiple websites on a single Radiant
installation. It also allows you to assign users to specific sites, scoping
all their administrative activity to that one domain.

Each site has its own independent sitemap/page-tree and these attributes:

  name: Whatever you want to call the site
  domain: A Ruby regular expression (without the //) to match the request
          against
  base_domain: A canonical domain name for doing quicker matches and for
               generating absolute URLs against
  homepage_id: The numerical database ID of the root page (usually
               you can just leave this alone).

Any existing pages that you have will be scoped to the 'Default' site, which
is the site that will be seen for requests that don't match a particular
base_domain.

In addition to scoping users to sites, layouts can also be scoped to a
particular site. Use the selection box on the edit layout page to assign a
layout to a site. If no site is chosen, the layout will be available for
selection from any site. Note that snippets are not limited in this way,
but that access to snippets has been DISABLED for "regular" users (those
users who are not developers or admins).

If you don't like it, feel free to make suggestions or change it :).

1) Unpack/checkout/export the extension into vendor/extensions of your 
   project.

== Other Extensions

Multi Site allows you to customize routes within your other extensions. To
restrict a route to a particular site, pass the site's name into the
conditions hash:

   map.resources :things, :conditions => { :site => 'My Site' }

You can also scope a route to multiple sites with an array:

   map.resources :things, :conditions => { :site => ['My Site', 'Your Site'] }
